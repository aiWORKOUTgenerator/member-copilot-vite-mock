DURATION OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
CRITICAL: The workout must fully utilize the {{duration}} minutes with appropriate exercise density.
- Short workouts (5-15 min): Focus on compound movements, minimal rest
- Medium workouts (16-30 min): Balance of compound and isolation exercises 
- Long workouts (31-45 min): Include variety, target multiple muscle groups, allow adequate rest between sets
- Each exercise should have realistic duration/reps/sets that add up to the total time
- Include transition time between exercises in your calculations
- Ensure no "dead time" - every minute should contribute to the workout goals

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Ensure total exercise duration matches requested time with appropriate exercise density
2. Scale exercise count based on total duration:
   - 5-15 minutes total: 4-11 total exercises (warm-up + main + cool-down)
   - 16-30 minutes total: 8-16 total exercises (warm-up + main + cool-down)
   - 31-45 minutes total: 12-22 total exercises (warm-up + main + cool-down)
3. Choose exercises appropriate for stated fitness level
4. Respect equipment limitations - provide alternatives if needed
5. Consider soreness areas and avoid aggravating them
6. Match workout intensity to stated energy level
7. Include proper progressions and regressions
8. Make all exercises achievable in the stated location
9. Provide clear, actionable instructions
10. Include motivational elements appropriate to user's goals
11. Ensure workout flows logically from warmup to cooldown
12. For longer durations (30+ minutes), include exercise variety to prevent monotony`,
