  steps: [
    { id: 'analyze-user', feature: 'user-analysis', operation: 'analyze' },
    { id: 'generate-base', feature: 'quick-workout', operation: 'generate' },
    { id: 'enhance-workout', feature: 'enhancement', operation: 'enhance' }
  ]
});
```

### **Feature Communication**
```typescript
const featureBus = new FeatureBus();
featureBus.subscribe('workout-generated', (data) => updateRecommendations(data));
const userPrefs = await featureBus.request('user-analysis', 'getPreferences', userId);
```

### **Quick Workout Generation**
```typescript
const quickWorkout = new QuickWorkoutFeature({ openAIService });
const workout = await quickWorkout.generateWorkout({
  duration: 30,
  fitnessLevel: 'intermediate',
  focus: 'strength',
  equipment: ['dumbbells']
});
