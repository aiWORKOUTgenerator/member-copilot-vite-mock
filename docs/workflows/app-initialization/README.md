# App Initialization Workflows

This directory contains documentation for the application initialization workflows that determine how the app starts up and manages user session state.

## Overview

The App Initialization workflows handle the critical startup sequence that determines which page users see when they load or refresh the application. These workflows are essential for providing a seamless user experience, especially for returning users who should be able to resume their progress.

## Workflows

### [App Initialization Workflow](./app-initialization-workflow.md)

The main workflow that handles:
- Application startup sequence
- Data loading from localStorage
- Initial page determination
- AI context initialization
- Error handling and recovery

**Key Features:**
- Current state analysis
- Identified limitations
- Recommended improvements
- Integration points

### [Skip Onboarding Workflow](./skip-onboarding-workflow.md)

Feature flag-driven workflow that:
- Determines if returning users should skip onboarding
- Uses feature flags for A/B testing and gradual rollout
- Tracks onboarding completion status
- Provides quick rollback capabilities

**Key Features:**
- Feature flag integration
- User experience optimization
- A/B testing support
- Gradual rollout management

The main workflow that handles:
- Application startup sequence
- Data loading from localStorage
- Initial page determination
- AI context initialization
- Error handling and recovery

**Key Features:**
- Current state analysis
- Identified limitations
- Recommended improvements
- Implementation priorities
- Testing strategies

## Related Workflows

### Upstream Dependencies
- **[Data Validation Workflows](../data-validation/)** - Validates loaded data
- **[AI Generation Workflows](../ai-generation/)** - Initializes AI services

### Downstream Consumers
- **[User Interaction Workflows](../user-interactions/)** - Handles user navigation
- **[System Orchestration Workflows](../system-orchestration/)** - Manages data persistence

## Quick Reference

### Current Behavior
- **Default Page**: Always starts at 'profile' page
- **Data Loading**: Only loads profile data from localStorage
- **Page Determination**: No smart detection based on data completion
- **Error Handling**: Basic fallback to empty state

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Smart Page Determination** - Resume from last incomplete step
2. **Complete Data Loading** - Load all workflow data (waiver, focus, etc.)
3. **Progress Persistence** - Remember user's last active page
4. **Data Validation** - Validate loaded data integrity

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Smart page determination (High impact, low risk)
2. **Phase 2**: Complete data loading (High impact, medium risk)
3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced error handling (Medium impact, low risk)

## Getting Started

To understand the current app initialization:

1. **Read the main workflow**: [App Initialization Workflow](./app-initialization-workflow.md)
2. **Review current limitations**: Focus on the "Current Limitations" section
3. **Plan improvements**: Use the "Recommended Improvements" section
4. **Implement changes**: Follow the "Implementation Priority" guidance

## Contributing

When modifying app initialization logic:

1. **Update this documentation** to reflect changes
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Update related workflows** that depend on initialization
4. **Consider user experience** impact of changes

## Metrics

Key metrics to monitor for app initialization:

- **Initial page load time** - Should be under 2 seconds
- **Data restoration success rate** - Should be above 95%
- **User drop-off at profile page** - Indicates poor resume experience
- **Data corruption frequency** - Should be below 1%
