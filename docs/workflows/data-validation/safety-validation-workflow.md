# Safety Validation Workflow

## Overview

The safety validation workflow is a critical system that ensures all generated workouts meet safety requirements based on user capabilities, equipment usage, and exercise combinations. This workflow acts as the final safety gate before workout delivery.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Profile Safety Check
- **Trigger:** Workout generation complete
- **Component:** `ProfileSafetyValidator`
- **Inputs:** User profile, fitness level, medical history
- **Process:** Validate workout against user capabilities
- **Outputs:** Profile safety assessment

### 2. Equipment Safety Validation
- **Trigger:** Profile check complete
- **Component:** `EquipmentSafetyChecker`
- **Inputs:** Selected equipment, exercise requirements
- **Process:** Verify equipment safety compatibility
- **Outputs:** Equipment safety verification

### 3. Exercise Sequence Analysis
- **Trigger:** Equipment validation complete
- **Component:** `ExerciseSequenceAnalyzer`
- **Inputs:** Exercise sequence, intensity levels
- **Process:** Analyze exercise combinations and progression
- **Outputs:** Sequence safety assessment

### 4. Real-time Safety Monitoring
- **Trigger:** Workout execution
- **Component:** `SafetyMonitor`
- **Inputs:** User feedback, performance metrics
- **Process:** Monitor safety thresholds
- **Outputs:** Safety alerts and adjustments

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Unsafe exercise combinations
- Equipment compatibility issues
- Intensity threshold violations

### Service Failures
- Validation service disruption
- Data access errors
- Real-time monitoring failures

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Conservative exercise substitution
- Equipment-free alternatives
- Reduced intensity options
