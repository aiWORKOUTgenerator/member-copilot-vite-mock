# Constraint Checking Workflow

## Overview

The constraint checking workflow enforces business rules and system constraints across all operations. This workflow ensures data consistency, operational safety, and business logic compliance throughout the system.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Rule Collection
- **Trigger:** Operation request received
- **Component:** `RuleCollector`
- **Inputs:** Operation context, system state
- **Process:** Gather applicable rules
- **Outputs:** Rule set

### 2. Dependency Analysis
- **Trigger:** Rules collected
- **Component:** `DependencyAnalyzer`
- **Inputs:** Rule set, operation data
- **Process:** Analyze rule dependencies
- **Outputs:** Ordered constraints

### 3. Constraint Evaluation
- **Trigger:** Dependencies analyzed
- **Component:** `ConstraintEvaluator`
- **Inputs:** Ordered constraints, data
- **Process:** Evaluate constraints
- **Outputs:** Evaluation results

### 4. Violation Resolution
- **Trigger:** Constraints evaluated
- **Component:** `ViolationResolver`
- **Inputs:** Evaluation results
- **Process:** Handle violations
- **Outputs:** Resolution actions

## Error Handling

### Constraint Errors
- Rule violations
- Dependency conflicts
- Evaluation failures

### Service Failures
- Rule engine errors
- Evaluation service failures
- Resolution errors

### Recovery Actions
- Rule relaxation
- Partial enforcement
- Operation rejection

### Integration Points
- **Data Flow**: Operation Request → Constraint Checking → Enforcement
- **Event Triggers**: Operation requests trigger constraint checking
- **Fallback Chain**: Full Constraints → Partial Constraints → Critical Only
