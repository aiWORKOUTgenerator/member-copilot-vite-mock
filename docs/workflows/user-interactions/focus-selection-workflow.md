# Focus Selection Workflow

## Overview

The focus selection workflow manages the process of determining and optimizing workout focus areas based on user goals, equipment availability, and training history. This workflow ensures workouts target appropriate muscle groups and training objectives.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Goal Analysis
- **Trigger:** User accessing focus selection
- **Component:** `FocusAnalyzer`
- **Inputs:** User goals, training history
- **Process:** Analyze training needs
- **Outputs:** Recommended focus areas

### 2. Equipment Compatibility
- **Trigger:** Focus areas identified
- **Component:** `EquipmentMatcher`
- **Inputs:** Focus areas, available equipment
- **Process:** Match focus to equipment
- **Outputs:** Equipment-compatible focus options

### 3. Progressive Planning
- **Trigger:** Compatible focus selected
- **Component:** `ProgressionPlanner`
- **Inputs:** Selected focus, user level
- **Process:** Plan progression path
- **Outputs:** Progressive focus strategy

### 4. Focus Integration
- **Trigger:** Strategy complete
- **Component:** `WorkoutIntegrator`
- **Inputs:** Focus strategy
- **Process:** Integrate with workout
- **Outputs:** Focus-optimized parameters

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Invalid focus selection
- Equipment mismatch
- Progression conflicts

### Service Failures
- Analysis service errors
- Integration failures
- Planning disruptions

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Default focus options
- Equipment alternatives
- Simplified progressions
