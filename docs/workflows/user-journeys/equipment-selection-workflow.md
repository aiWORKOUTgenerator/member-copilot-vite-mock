# Equipment Selection Workflow

## Overview

The equipment selection workflow manages the process of identifying, validating, and optimizing available equipment for workout generation. This workflow ensures workouts are created using appropriate equipment while considering space constraints and user preferences.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Equipment Analysis
- **Trigger:** User accessing equipment setup
- **Component:** `EquipmentAnalyzer`
- **Inputs:** Available equipment list
- **Process:** Validate equipment availability
- **Outputs:** Verified equipment list

### 2. Alternative Suggestions
- **Trigger:** Equipment list verified
- **Component:** `AlternativeFinder`
- **Inputs:** Equipment list, user preferences
- **Process:** Identify alternatives
- **Outputs:** Extended equipment options

### 3. Space Optimization
- **Trigger:** Equipment options ready
- **Component:** `SpaceOptimizer`
- **Inputs:** Equipment list, space constraints
- **Process:** Optimize equipment usage
- **Outputs:** Space-efficient selection

### 4. Equipment Integration
- **Trigger:** Optimization complete
- **Component:** `WorkoutIntegrator`
- **Inputs:** Optimized equipment list
- **Process:** Integrate with workout
- **Outputs:** Equipment-aware parameters

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Invalid equipment selection
- Space constraint violations
- Incompatible combinations

### Service Failures
- Analysis service errors
- Integration failures
- Optimization errors

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Bodyweight alternatives
- Minimal equipment options
- Space-saving substitutes
